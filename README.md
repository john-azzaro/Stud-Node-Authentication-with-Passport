## What is Authentication?
When a user logs into your system it needs to be checked if it is correct. For example, suppose you have a commerce website that requires users to register and sign into an an account to purchase items. In other words, this comparison of passwords is authentication in action.  Of course, passwords should never be stored as plain text in a database (or anywhere else for that matter) because identifying users and providing corresponding access to thier respective content (depending on their id) keep those passwords safe.
