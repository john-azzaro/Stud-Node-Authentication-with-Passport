## What is Authentication?
First, it should be clear that passwords should never be stored as plain text in a database (or anywhere else for that matter) because identifying users and providing corresponding access to thier respective content (depending on their id) keep those passwords safe. For authentication, when a user logs into your system it needs to be checked if it is correct. For example, suppose you have a commerce website that requires users to register and sign into an an account to purchase items. The application would provide a registration and login form with credentials such as a name and password to verify that the user is who they say they are.
